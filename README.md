# DeepLearning-Convolutional-Deep-Neural-Network-for-Image-Classification

# AIM
To develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) classification model for the given dataset.

# THEORY
The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each of size 28Ã—28 pixels. The task is to classify these images into their respective digit categories. CNNs are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks as they can automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features through convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

# RESULT
Successfully develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) classification model for the given dataset.
